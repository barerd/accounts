Forgot my password:

%form#login_form
  .label_input
    %label{:for=>"email"} E-mail
    %input{:name=>"email", :id=>"email", :type=>"text"} 
  .button
    %button{:type => "submit", :value => "Submit"}

We will send an e-mail to you with a one-time link that will 
take you to a page that will allow you to change your password.

Meanwhile, if you remember your password, it will still work until you change it.
